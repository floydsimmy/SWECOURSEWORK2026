# tests/test_models.py
# =====================
# Automated tests for the data models (src/game/models.py).
#
# Each test function checks that a model class stores and returns data correctly.
# Run all tests from the project root with:
#   pytest
#
# Tests to write (once models.py is implemented):
#   - test that a Player is created with the correct name and empty hand
#   - test that a Card has the right type (suspect / weapon / room)
#   - test that a Room stores its name and connected corridors correctly
